Introduction to the Xcode environment and testing

Some ideas to improve the app are:
  - Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
  - Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
  - Implement a way to change the color of the text as well

App Brainstorming:
  Youtube:
    - Picture-in-Picture mode lets you watch a video while having exited the app
    - Multiple account management

  Spotify:
    - Gives you a live player in the lock screen that allows you to change the music
    - Can download outside music and listen in-app

  Instagram:
    - Combines contact list to see who else uses the app
    - Can sign into multiple accounts and have it saved

  GroupMe:
    - Separate group chats into multiple smaller chats for organization
    - Combines contact list to show you who else might use the app

My personal app:
  For my app, I would like to build a gym progress   tracker that can log workouts and weights lifted to track progress. This app would also show you your progress in a graph view for easier viewing. I would like this app to track caloric intake as well and store them in a nice UI. This gym tracker would also allow you to view your friend's progress if they would want it public.
